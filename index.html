        <p class="lead mb-4">After a night of stress and anticipation, I rushed over to the stack of freshly printed programs for my school‚Äôs film festival. I felt a surge of pride when I saw my name on the list of featured films. I also felt incredibly nervous because so many of my classmates and their families would be watching Nite Owl, my three-minute documentary about a Bay Area street artist, which I‚Äôd poured a semester of work into. I never imagined my eight-year-old self who made stop motion movies about Lego ninjas would later be featured at my high school‚Äôs film festivals.
I'd rather be behind the camera than in front of it, I don't like being the center of attention, and the spotlight scares me. However, when filmmaking, I construct worlds. I invite others to see what I see and evoke feelings in them. During shooting, I experience a sense of control unlike any other; I‚Äôm the writer, director, producer and editor, and I like building worlds out of my experiences and imagination. I find it deeply satisfying to manage a project from creation to completion according to my vision. While directing, I create the scenes and help them come to life.
When I was shooting my film, More Than Just a Game, featured at my school‚Äôs next film festival, I‚Äôd decided beforehand to make an upbeat, exciting and fun movie filmed in an arcade. The location was less than desirable, but after a day of driving around scouting an arcade that would let me film, it was the only one that agreed to be my site. Next, I recruited my actors, a much easier process because they were friends eager to hop on the project. I also wrote dialogue and shopped for costumes, deciding on a cheap, shiny, red tracksuit for my main character.
The day of the shoot was challenging because I didn't have much control over the loud, busy arcade. Although I‚Äôd given my actors the script ahead of time, they hadn‚Äôt had time to rehearse, but I trusted their abilities as actors. It was also my first time directing dialogue, so I had to rely more on my actors, which made me nervous, as I knew how I wanted every line delivered. When my shoot ran over by two hours, I also discovered that making a movie with dialogue involves many more takes. Additionally, I worried about losing control of my project, 
<br><br>wasting all the time I‚Äôd put into it by making a movie I wasn't satisfied with. I was also self-conscious filming in a crowded arcade and worried I hadn't prepared enough. However, after setting up my tripod and positioning the camera, I was as ready as I could be. The shooting went much smoother than I‚Äôd imagined, but the mishaps that day ranged from kids photobombing my scenes to seagulls screeching outside during a critical moment of dialogue to simply running out of quarters. When I got home later, mentally and physically exhausted, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment.
While I love the process of filmmaking, I struggle with getting started; every time I get an idea for a film I find an aspect about it that I‚Äôm disappointed with. Editing presents other joys and challenges. I truly enjoy finding the perfect arrangement for my shots and color correcting to give my film a unique look, but I dislike and usually try to avoid keyframing and other animation.  Surprisingly, choosing the right font for my credits drives me crazy. Like many artists, I find it hard to decide when my film is ‚Äúdone.‚Äù However despite the stresses, long hours and multiple frustrations, filmmaking offers fun times, creative expression and an outlet to share my vision with the world. I always welcome the challenges that come with filmmaking because when I see my finished project I always feel proud and independent.
